        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>   I was born and raised in the state of Arizona until the age of 17. I joined the Marine Corps out of high school where I served for almost 9 years. I got out of the military and moved to Las Vegas, NV where I still reside. I changed job fields after leaving the military and became an industrial hygienist. I have one child who is 14 and I have a fiance who has two children of her own. I decided once again to change my profession and have completed one bootcamp already for coding and this is my second.</p>
