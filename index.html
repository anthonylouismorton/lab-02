        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I was born in the state of Arizona until the age of 17. Shortly after high school, I joined the United States Marine Corps. In the Marine Corps I served my first enlistment as a motor transport operator and went on one deployment to Iraq for 13 months. After returning from Iraq, I re-enlisted and changed career fields and became an imagery analyst. During my second enlistment I was deployed to Afghanistan and aboard the USS New Orleans. After the military I moved to Las Vegas, NV where I currently reside. My first career outside of the military was as an industrial hygienist. I am currently in the process of changing career fields again and hope to become a software developer.</p>
        <p>I have one child of my own named Makenna, who will be turning 15 in November. I am currently engaged to my fianc√©, Kristin who has two children of her own. Their names are Kaydin, 14, and Layla, 8. My hobbies include watching sports, playing hockey, and playing video games. I hope that one day I will be able to travel around the United States while working remotely and make trips to other countries.
